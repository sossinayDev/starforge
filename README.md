# Starforge
***One of the worst sandbox MMOs in existence***
Starforge will be an MMO Sandbox game playing in space. It will consist of many solar systems scattered across different districts of the galaxy. The only rule outside of Galaxentre is: **There are none.**

## Features
### Solar system simulation
Solar systems within Starforge are actually moving. The planets orbit the sun(s) *(Yes there are/will be multi-star systems)*, moons orbit their planets and moons of moons orbit moons. This system is made, so it's **synchronized** all around the globe. The positions of ships and objects are **relative to the closest body**. If you land your ship on the border of Ectoso and log off, when you log in you will still be on the border of Ectoso.
