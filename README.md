# Starforge
***One of the worst sandbox MMOs in existence***

Starforge will be an MMO Sandbox game playing in space. It will consist of many solar systems scattered across different districts of the galaxy. The only rule outside of Galaxentre is: **There are none.**

## Features
### Solar system simulation
Solar systems within Starforge are actually moving. The planets orbit the sun(s) *(Yes there are/will be multi-star systems)*, moons orbit their planets and moons of moons orbit moons. This system is made, so it's **synchronized** all around the globe. The positions of ships and objects are **relative to the closest body**. If you land your ship on the border of Ectoso and log off, when you log in you will still be on the border of Ectoso.
### Real-time multiplayer
The whole galaxy is online, and you can fly around, visit planets and discover new systems with your firends!
### Ship designing
Design and fly your own spaceships. Decide, how many engines and weapons are on board, how much fuel you'll carry and increase your power with armor and better parts!
### Multiple solar systems
If find your way to a stargate, you might not be able to recognize it. But stargates are really powerful accelerators, that will launch your ship to ridiculous speeds. You will black out, and wake up in a completely different solar system! _Hint: Use the navigation system to find an locate objects in the current solar system!_
### Weapon system
As said before, you can choose how many and what types of weapons you want to carry. Weather you choose light missiles, long-range cannons or even lasers is up to you! The weapon system adapts to your configuration and gives you full control of all weapons on your ship. Use them wisely, or you might get in trouble with some gangster guild.
## Upcoming updates
### PvP and PvE
Of course PvP is a must-have for any online game! The combat system of Starforge is currently in development and it's functionality is quickly increasing.
### Guild
Join the guild and team up with friends to beat missions! It might be a simple data transport, a rescue or even a bounty! It's up to you to decide!
### Market system
Buy new items and sell old ones. Fabricate a ship and mass-produce it. The market will become a really important feature of Starforge.
### Fuel, electricity and weight
It would be strange if you could move a 1000 ton spaceship infinitely using one engine right?
### Planetary surfaces
Visit planets, scout city ruins, scavenge crashed ships. I'm planning a lot.
## Now, feel free to try it out yourself, and give me feedback! *(Maybe I even add your wishes to the game)*
